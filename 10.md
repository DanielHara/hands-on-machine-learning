# Answers to Chapter 10: Introduction to Artificial Neural Networks with Keras

## Question 3
Because a classic perceptron uses the step function in the output (step(WX + b)), and not a sigmoid function (f(x) = 1 / (1 + exp(-x)), like in linear regression.
The step function is a hard function: it just outputs 0 and 1, which means just a hard prediction, without a sense of how certain the model is of its prediction.
On the other hand, the sigmoid function varies smoothly from 0 to 1, whereby 0.51 would be ranked as a prediction of the positive class with little certainty, while 0.9999 would hint
at the model being very convinced of its prediction.
Therefore, linear regression makes a more nuanced prediction and adds more information to it (i.e., a measure of how convinced the model is of its prediction), when compared to a classic perceptron.
